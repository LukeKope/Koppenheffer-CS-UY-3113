# Project 5 - Platformer
## Luke Koppenheffer

*Instructions*
- Use the arrow keys to move around
- Press space to jump

***To-Do***
1. Have checks in place to keep track of player lives (can lose lives from enemies or from falling off the stage)
	- To check if they fell off the stage, simply check the player's y position. If it goes off the viewport (i.e. < -4.5), 
	  they fell off screen and you can deduct a life and reset the player to a safe platform (or the start of the level)

2. Show you lose or you win text upon win/lose conditions

3. Add the AI to the game

4. Add sound to the game

5. Add more interesting level design, maybe even some verticality? Have the camera follow the player vertically

6. Make own custom assets
