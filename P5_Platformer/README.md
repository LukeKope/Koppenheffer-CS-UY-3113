*Instructions*
- Use the arrow keys to move around
- Press space to jump
- Jump on enemies to defeat them
- Reach the end of the level to win

***To-Do***
**Add sound, clean up the code base (abstract away initializing player for each level, reset enemy position on each time the player dies)**

1. Add an actual object (flag, door, etc.) to the end of the level so there's a visual indicator for victory

3. Add a more elegant way of tracking player lives other than doing it in main

5. Add sound to the game

6. Add more interesting level design, maybe even some verticality? Have the camera follow the player vertically

7. Make own custom assets
