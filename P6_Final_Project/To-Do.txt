To-Do

Battle System
---
- Fix camera and starting position for player and enemy in the battle room
- Have player health consistent (needs to be a state object accessible outside of the battle class)
- Display enemy health above the enemy
- Display the move damage for each move

Done 
---
- Get UI working for move selection [DONE]
- Get player and enemy they collided with to spawn into the battle room [DONE]
- Create a vector of moves that the player has access to in the battle phase [DONE]
- Make a "move" class that has attributes of damage, crit chance, accuracy, MP, etc. [DONE]


Camera
---
- Need to update the Y position of the camera [DONE]
- Lock the camera at a certain position 
- Fix the camera shake in the battle screen so there's a timer of some sorts
 -> Right now it just activates the shake every second because the player is being hit 
   every frame.


Enemies
---
- Enemies need to be able to fight the player
- Enemy needs to die if the player defeats them
- Display enemy health (can be scoped to the battle room)


Main Screen
---
- Don't let player walk out of the boundaries of the map
