# Project 6 - JRPG Game
## Luke Koppenheffer
*The slime enemy was created by me using Aseprite!*

For my final game, I will be working alone, and I wanted to make a brief JRPG type game that features turn-based combat. Something along the lines of the original Final Fantasy 7 and Chrono Trigger, where you can recruit party members and run into enemies, which will transition them to the battle screen where turn-based combat occurs. The game will end with a final boss battle, using the increased abilities and experience points players have gained along the way to defeat a more powerful foe.

As for the visual style, I was envisioning a top-down look akin to the original Legend of Zelda game, having one large open world for the player to explore (the camera would follow the player as they moved). Different sections of the world would have AI enemies that moved in different ways and fought using different abilities.

Here is some [Chrono Trigger gameplay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXcl38zbqmw) that captures the main aspects of the game. (Gameplay starts at 36 seconds)

The player can walk around and explore the world, get into encounters with enemy AI, and fight them in turn-based combat. I would like to have party members as well, but that is more of a stretch goal once the core combat mechanics are working for a single player character and multiple AI enemies.

*Instructions*
- Use the arrow keys to move around
- Collide with enemies to enter turn based combat
- Defeat the all enemies to win!
